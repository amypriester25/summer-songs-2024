            <h2>My Review</h2>
            <p>I had never heard of Teddy Swims before this song and I must say, he has a beautiful voice. This song in particular is full of heart and soul, you can literally hear the pain through his voice. While this is a good song, itâ€™s not exactly the beat you want to blast in the summer. I rate it 4/5. </p>

            <h2>My Rating</h2>
            <p>4/5</p>
