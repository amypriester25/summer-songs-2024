            <h2>Song Title</h2>
            <p>Birds of a Feather</p>

            <h2>Performer</h2>
            <p>Billie Eilish</p>

            <h2>My Review</h2>
            <p>The reason I gave lower ratings to newer artists like Teddy Swims and Benson Boone is because comparing them to a seasoned professional like Billie Eilish feels like comparing Mozart to a third-grade piano player. New artists are great and we need them to keep the music industry fresh, but sometimes they can’t beat a hit from another artist who has more experience and fame under their belt. Birds of a Feather is a masterpiece. I’ve never heard a love song so earnest and pained but still sweet. By now we know what Billie is capable of, but this song was still surprising. She rarely ventures from her quiet, soft tone, but in this song, she showcased her range and control. Finneas always wows me with his production skills and the track in the background is a testament to his greatness. 5/5 stars for Billie and her brother. </p>

            <h2>My Rating</h2>
            <p>5/5</p>
