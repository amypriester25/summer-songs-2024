            <p>Sabrina Carpenter</p>

            <h2>My Review</h2>
            <p>And she does it agan. Sabrina couldn’t miss a beat if she tried. Not only was this single the perfect following act to Espresso, it was also wonderful enough to stand on its own, earning Sabrina yet another spot in the Billboard Top Ten. This summer, Sabrina provided us with flirty and fun pop but added retro touches. I think it’s the jukebox nature of these singles that charmed listeners, making us fall in love all summer long. While Espresso was an anthem, Please Please Please slows things down a bit while keeping listeners on their toes. With yet another sweet and playful song, Sabrina gains another 5/5 star rating. </p>

            <h2>My Rating</h2>
            <p>5/5</p>
