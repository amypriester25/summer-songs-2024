            <h2>My Review</h2>
            <p>Similar to Teddy Swims, I hadn’t heard of Benson Boone before this song. He has a strong voice and you can hear the emotion behind it. While his type of music isn’t my personal favorite, I can see why so many people like it. I know this song also went viral on TikTok which I’m sure helped it land on the Billboard charts. Overall, I think it’s good but too intense to blast while I’m trying to relax on a summer day. I rate it 3/5 stars.</p>

            <h2>My Rating</h2>
            <p>3/5</p>
