            <h2>Song Title</h2>
            <p>Too Sweet</p>

            <h2>Performer</h2>
            <p>Hozier</p>

            <h2>My Review</h2>
            <p>Per usual, Hozier produced a stunning single. His smooth, folksy voice that borders on angelic never disappoints and this song was no exception. What I appreciate about Hozier is that he always produces something completely unique for his listeners. No other artist could copy what Hozier does and that is what makes his music so special. Iâ€™m thrilled to see one of his songs in the top ten. The only reason I am not giving this song a 5/5 is because it feels more like a song for the fall. I will be awarding 5s to summer bops only. 4/5 stars.</p>

            <h2>My Rating</h2>
            <p>4/5</p>
