            <h2>Song Title</h2>
            <p>I Had Some Help</p>

            <h2>Performer</h2>
            <p>Post Malone ft. Morgan Wallen</p>

            <h2>My Review</h2>
            <p>While I love that Post Malone is venturing into country music and his raspy voice fits the genre, I miss his angsty rap and stoner pop music. Beerbongs & Bentleys was one of his best albums because it was raw, you knew exactly what he was feeling just by listening to his songs. However, I hope his genre switch is a sign of him being healthier and happy now. Country music in general is perfect for summer, and this song is no exception. I give it 4.5/5 stars.  </p>

            <h2>My Rating</h2>
            <p>4.5/5</p>
