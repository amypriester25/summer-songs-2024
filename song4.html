            <h2>My Review</h2>
            <p>At first, I did not want to give this song a good rating. I am so tired of watching songs with cheesy lyrics go viral on TikTok and subsequently skyrocket on the charts. In my opinion, itâ€™s rarely deserved. Much better songs with legitimate artists behind them tend to get left behind (*cough cough, Chappell Roan, cough cough*). However, after listening to this song all the way through, I have to admit it's a fun one. The beat and vibe are perfect for a summer pool party or beach day. Although I wouldn't personally put it in the top ten for the summer, I understand why it made the list. I give it 3/5 stars.</p>

            <h2>My Rating</h2>
            <p>3/5</p>
